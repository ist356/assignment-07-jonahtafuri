## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

While my understanding of data mining is somewhat limited I was able to figure this assignment out fairly easily. It is a lot of similar features to 5-4.py (craigslist scraper) so I was able to pretty much copy that. Since the menu is separated into sections with a common class name I decided it would be best to scrape each section separately and combine them all together. This way I didn't need to do anything fancy to assign categories. I did run into issues where the code would break if the code grabbed NA values but this was dealt with using if/else statements pretty easily. I don't often use that function so it was nice to be able to with this assignment.
